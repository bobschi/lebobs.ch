I'm excited, and kind of panicky about the end of October. First of all, I'm studying for my statistics exam, that's going to be on November 11th. Secondly, and more interestingly, I'm going to attend a lot of talks and even a workshop and a concert that are part of the [Vienna Open 2013][vo13] Design Festival. Since this has gone under my radar for most of the time, and under the radar of a lot of people that are usually a lot better informed than me, I'm going to spend some time talking about what this festival is, rather than just dumping all of the fun stuff I'm going to do here.
