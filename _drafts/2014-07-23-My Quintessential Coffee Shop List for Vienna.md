title: My Quintessential Coffee Shop List for Vienna
comments: true

Oftentimes, when people come to Vienna, either as tourists or to stay for some time, they have heard about the famous Viennese coffeehouse culture, about famous places like Café Central or Café Prückl or the Hawelka; but this part of Viennese coffee culture seems stale. While it is true that the places are elegant, they are often very pricey, kinda formal and the coffee they serve is not to everybody's taste. It's worth to go there for the live music, like at Café Sperl on Sunday Afternoons (only September to June, mind you), and to have a taste of some traditional Viennese things like Melange, Einspänner or some of the sweets they have like Apfelstrudel. Wikipedia offers a quite comprehensive [list of notable classical coffeehouses in Vienna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_coffee_house#Notable_coffee_houses).

But I am not really interested in spending my time and money there. Simply put, I wouldn't got to any of the aforementioned cafés for the coffee. So where do I drink my brew and spend my money?

Vienna over the last years has grow a quite lively culture of [Third Wave Coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Wave_Coffee) shops. I generally enjoy good drink and food, and I really enjoy talking to people have an appreciation for quality. Talking to the person who has roasted the beans for the espresso that you're enjoying at the same time can be quite an interesting thing to do.

I don't claim to know every Third Wave Coffee bar in Vienna, but I'm trying my best. If I missed anything, just give me a shoutout. For those of you that can read German, you should read [mkln's list of Third Wave Coffee shops](https://mkln.org/guter-kaffee-in-wien/). More opinionated than my list, and certainly a lot more extensive, but very focused on espresso. While I enjoy a good espresso or flat white, I also like my filter.

## 1. [Kaffeemodul](http://kaffeemodul.at/)

The small shop is situated next to a stop of tramway Two; it offers barely enough space for a five people; the furniture is functional and simple; everything is focused on the bar, where either Boris or Valentin will be making coffee. At the time of writing my favourite coffee joint in Vienna. Why?

They serve mostly [Quijote Kaffee](http://www.quijote-kaffee.de/) although most of the time there's a pack or two of "special coffees" as well. If you are a little peckish you can have some cookies and sometimes cake by [Tortenmanufaktur Zola Auböck](http://zola-auboeck.com/). During summer they also have cold brew, but only small batches so get there early.

To boil it down for you: Boris and Valentin serve some of the best coffee in town, are very knowledgable and always manage to make me feel welcome.
