title: My Quintessential Coffee Shop List for Vienna

Oftentimes when people come to Vienna, they have heard about the famous Viennese coffeehouse culture, commemorated by places like Café Central or Café Prückl or the Hawelka; but this part of Viennese coffee culture seems stale and stagnant to me. While it is true that the places offer a very impressive ambiente, they are often very pricey, the coffee they serve is usually kinda bad and they're just not places I'd go to relax or work. It might be worth to go there for the live music, like to Café Sperl on Sunday Afternoons (only September to June, mind you), and to have a taste of some traditional Viennese things like Melange, Einspänner or Apfelstrudel. Wikipedia offers a quite comprehensive [list of notable classical coffeehouses in Vienna][1]. But if you _really_ want to get an impression of nowadays Vienna that is not clouded by shallow Habsburger romanticism you can easily skip those places.

Personally, I am not really interested in spending my time and money there. I tried it, but simply put, you won't find me at any of the aforementioned cafés. So where do I drink my brew?

Over the last years a quite lively culture of [Third Wave Coffee][2] shops has developed in Vienna. I generally appreciate artisanship, well prepared and high quality beverages and food, and I really enjoy talking to people have an appreciation for quality. Talking to the person who has roasted the beans for the espresso that you're enjoying at the same time can be quite an interesting thing to do.

For those of you who can read German, you should read [mkln's list of Third Wave Coffee shops][3]. More opinionated than my list, and certainly a lot more extensive, but focused on espresso. I like both filter and espresso, but I'm mainly doing this for the filter and cold brew.

Definitely my favourite shop if you're going somewhere just for the coffee. Boris and Valentin not only make awesome coffee, they'll always take time to talk to you or joke around with their regulars. Although it can get crowded at times, they prepare your take-away cappucino or
