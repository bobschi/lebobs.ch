The small shop is situated next to the stop "Josefsstädter Straße/Lederergasse" of tramway Two; it offers barely enough space for a six people (seven, if the door is closed); there's a big bench to sit on and some boards fold down to make seats and tables; everything is focused on the bar, where either Boris or Valentin will be making coffee. At the time of writing my favourite coffee joint in Vienna. Why?

They serve mostly [Quijote Kaffee](http://www.quijote-kaffee.de/) although most of the time there's a pack or two of "special coffees" as well; at the time of writing, there's San Adolfo, Kolumbien by the Handsome Coffee Roasters from LA. they carry the whole Quijote Kaffee sortiment, so I'd like to encourage you to try around until you find a roast that suits you. If you are a little peckish you can have some cookies and sometimes cake by [Tortenmanufaktur Zola Auböck](http://zola-auboeck.com/). During summer they also have cold brew, but only small batches so get there early.

To boil it down for you: Boris and Valentin serve some of the best coffee in town, are very knowledgable and always manage to make me feel welcome.
