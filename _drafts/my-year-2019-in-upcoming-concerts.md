So, I did spend some money on concert tickets last year and this year ... I decided some years ago to do the concerts that I absolutely want to see without compromise or long thought. So far the following concerts fell into the »OMG GOTTA SEE THIS« category:

- **Depedro** at WUK on February 28th
- **The Dead South** at WUK on April 8th (I will have to sell those because I'm going to Italy on those days!)
- **GoGo Penguin** at Porgy&Bess on May 9th
- **Tool** at Wiener Stadthalle on June 5th
- **Tash Sultana** at Arena Wien, Open Air, on July 16th
- **Calexico** and **Iron & Wine** at Wiener Konzerthaus on July 28th
- **José González** At Arena Wien, Open Air, on September 12th

My year in concerts looks exciting as hell, and it's bound to get a lot better. Focus is a great thing. Saying no to a lot of little things means I get to spend money and time on the big things. That said, I look forward to seeing a few of my personal, smaller favourites thigs year as well. I'm keeping my eyes out for opportunities to see anything a little more niche.

By the way: I have an extra ticket for Depedro next week. Anybody want to tag along?
