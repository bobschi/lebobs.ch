This is something that's been bothering me a lot lately. Screen time. Quality time versus work versus wasted time. Intentionality is the underlying theme.

Matt D'Avella runs a channel on minimalism, and he seems like one of the most likable of that crowd. He seems ... sensible.

Funnily enough: I'm already using most of his tips on my iPhone and iPad, and it has gotten down my social media usage a lot. I think I'll double down on that a lot more. His suggestions are:

1. Track your screen time.
2. Turn off notifications.
3. Set your phone to black & white.
4. Delete social media from your phone.
5. Block distracting websites.
6. Create some distance.

I guess I'll write a post on this later. My friends are constantly complaining that I'm hard to reach. That's because I not only turned off most notifications, I also usually engage DnD-mode when I'm working ... Yeah, I've got some feelings and ideas about this, and I've experimented a bit. I'll take the time to write about it when I'm done with my projects for [Vienna Burning Ball](http://burners.at/vbb2019) and my BSc thesis.
