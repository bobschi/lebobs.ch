Hi, my name is Florian Holzner. I currently live in Vienna, Austria, where I study Medical Informatics at the Vienna University of Technology. My blog is mostly about stuff that interests me: cooking, computers, medicine, design, photography, typography.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me social media stuff in the footer, or you could just email me at *hello at this domain*.
