## About Florian Holzner
Hi, my name is Florian Holzner. I live in Vienna, Austria. I am currently studying Human Medicine and Medical Informatics. Those are two distinct studies, one at the Medical University of Vienna, the other at the Vienna University of Technology. My Blog is mostly about stuff that interests me: Computers, Medicine, Design, Photography, Typography, and so on. In neither of my studies nor my fields of interest am I a master, so please, feel free to <em>correct me when I make mistakes</em>, but also tell me when I did good.

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
You can contact me in various ways, primarily via [twitter](https://twitter.com/bobschi "my twitter profile"). You can browse through my repositories on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/florianholzner "my bitbucket profile") or [github](https://github.com/bobschi "my github profile"). I have a [Soup](http://bobschi.soup.io/ "One of my tumble logs") and a [tumblelog](http://bobsch.tumblr.com "My tumblr") that I rarely use. On tumblr, you will find most of the pictures I take with my iPhone, and if you go a little further into the past, a lot of titbits I collected while surfing around the internet. Beware: the earlier parts of my tumblr-log are definitely <em>NSFW</em>. You'll find one of my first tries to start blogging on [tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/tumblelog/florianholzner "a more serious aproach") as well.

I'm always happy to answer any <script> document.write("<n uers=\"obofpuv\@yninovg.pbz\" ery=\"absbyybj\">".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c){return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);})); </script>email</a>s I get, but it might take some time.

## About this page
This is my <em>personal</em> weblog.

As some of you might guess, this site was heavily inspired by [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/about "Mark's personal about page")'s exceptionally beautiful and useful [Dive into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.org/ "Dive into HTML5"). Thanks Mark, for your books, and especially for Dive into HTML5 and Dive into Python. You rock!
