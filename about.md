Hi, my name is Florian Holzner. I currently live in Vienna, Austria, where I study Medical Informatics at the Vienna University of Technology. My blog is mostly about stuff that interests me: cooking, computers, medicine, design, photography, typography.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on many a social networking site---[twitter](https://twitter.com/bobschi), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/florianholzner), [google+](https://www.facebook.com/florianholzner), [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/florianholzner), [github](https://github.com/bobschi) and [tumblr](http://bobschi.tumblr.com/)---or you could just email me at <mark>hello at this domain</mark> ([GNUPG-KEY 1A16BC6C](https://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=index&search=0x1A16BC6C&fingerprint=on)).

Meanwhile, please enjoy this picture of me (red shirt) talking.
