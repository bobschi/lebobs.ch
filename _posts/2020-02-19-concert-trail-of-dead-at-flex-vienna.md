I've started my year late when it comes to concerts. After ending on a high
point with Kishibashi last year at the Chelsea, I've not seen a concert in
January. But finally, after about two months of no live music, the end of
February had arrived, and with it the concerts I've been waiting for. To start
it all off, [...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead][tod] are kicking
this year off with a live show at the Flex, Vienna. ToD released a new album
called [X: The Godless Void and Other Stories][x] in January this year, and are
touring in support of it. They are a treat to experience live, and if you
haven't caught them live, you definitely should. They've been writing and
performing music for over 20 years, they've created an amazing body of works,
and their live shows, amazingly, are still fucking great.

I've done an Apple Music playlist from the setlist that you can find below:

I've skipped buying merch this time, but if you like the album artwork, you
should have a look at [Conrad's visual works][ckart]. He does the album covers
and all merch artwork, and I just love his style. Look at this design for a
Trail of Dead print in a tarot card style ...
