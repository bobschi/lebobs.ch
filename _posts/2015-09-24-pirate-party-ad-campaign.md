The Austrian Pirate Party ([PPÃ–](https://www.piratenpartei.at)) is currently using a few prominent Austrian politicians to generate some attention for them prior to elections in Upper Austria and Vienna as well as AKVorrat's campaign against the Staatsschutzgesetz[^1].

[^1]: Basically Austria is supposed to get a new intelligence service and a lot of new legislation dealing with the security of the state. Simply put it will give the state a very potent, very loosely governed secret police that's mostly concerned with spying on Austria's citizens. Sounds terrible, right?
