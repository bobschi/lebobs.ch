title: Creating an eBook
published: false
teaser: Getting annoyed with carrying my rulebooks with me to sessions and with the atrocious performance of Paizo's PDFs in mind, I embark on a quest to generate EPUBs from the PRDs. If you don't know any of those shorthands, come in and learn! If you have always wanted to create your own eBook, join me.

This has been an issue that has been bothering me for quite some time. Many people think that PDFs are eBooks. Guys, you're wrong. Absolutely wrong. A PDF is to an eBook as HTML is to a programming language. The differences are subtle, but they are there. And while releasing your dead-tree-books as PDFs is a noble gesture, it is not releasing your books as eBooks.
