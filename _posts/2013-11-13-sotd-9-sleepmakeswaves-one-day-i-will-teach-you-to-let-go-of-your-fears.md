This is beautiful. I'm kinda disappointed at myself that I missed their show---they played as the support for 65daysofstatic right here in Vienna---because I'm stupid, and was running late, but what the hell. Let's just enjoy the music.

Oh, and I've discovered a channel on YouTube that has pretty awesome post-rock mixes and playlists. More post-rock incoming.
