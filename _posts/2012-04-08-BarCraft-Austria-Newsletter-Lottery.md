title: BarCraft Austria Newsletter Lottery
---

BarCraft Austria recently launched a newsletter in order to keep people who don't like Facebook up to date with their events. I did the sign-up page and the preliminary layouts for the emails. I am not happy with them. They are going to improve. On the other hand, content is king, and on that front the BarCraft Austria newsletter delivers.

If you sign up until April 14th, you enter the lottory to win an Anno 2070 Limited Edition, amongst other things. You can sign up [here](http://newsletter.barcraft.at).
