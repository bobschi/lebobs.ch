Baroness just announced a [US tour](https://www.facebook.com/YourBaroness/posts/10153581106585056) for November and December 2015 just after [announcing their next album](https://www.facebook.com/YourBaroness/photos/a.489621825055.293076.8993175055/10153523497485056/?type=3), **Purple**, and releasing a kick-ass video for their latest single *Chlorine & Wine*. You can pre-order Purple through their [pledgemusic](http://smarturl.it/dpurple) shop if you want some cool extras, like album art shirts and so on. I'm unfortunately too poor right now to get the deluxe bundle, but I'll grab one of the T-Shirt packages. Not sure if I want the full album art or the random album art quadrant though ...

I'm really hoping for a EU tour in 2016, which would make it 3 years since my last Baroness concert. I can't wait to see them play again! I've been watching [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om3L0akQ1Ew) [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE8Y8Jufdzk) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGmpGZEgpiE) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhREHBkPRNo) [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkRjox22P1Y) [2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSutu6zCluU), and I'm getting really excited.
