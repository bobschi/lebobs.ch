I have been listening to this since  I discovered it on the last <a href="https://themath-rocknews.bandcamp.com">Math-Rock News</a> Sampler. It's such a great song! Really nice instrumentation and arrangement to keep me happy and entertained, while being catchy and poppy enough to be appealing to my more vanilla friends. I would love to see them play live. While that is not in the books at the moment for me, I just got myself their discography from Bandcamp. It's a small investment, really, so go and grab yourself <a href="http://orchardslive.bandcamp.com/">some of their stuff</a>! I think some of their older stuff is even free, if you are on a budget.
