[Markus](http://nuclearsquid.com/ "Blog of Markus Prinz") told me about [github pages](http://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages Readme") some time ago, and this weekend I finally set down and purchased my domain, set up the repository, site structure etc. pp., the end product of which you can see here.

I **finally** went through with the plan to buy the domain [lebobs.ch][lebobsch] and setup a blog for myself. [][Markus] told me about [pages.github.com][ghpages] some time ago, and this weekend I finally set down and purchased my domain, set up the repository, site structure etc. pp., the end product of which you can see here.

I'm still undecided wether to blog on German or English. I guess I'll make up my mind while I'll create the layout and design for the page.
