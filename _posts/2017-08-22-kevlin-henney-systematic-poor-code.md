title: Kevlin Henney on bad coding habits

I watched Kevlin Henney talk with the slightly click-baity title ["Clean Coders Hate What Happens to Your Code When You Use These Enterprise Programming Tricks"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyCYva9DhsI) from this years London NDC Conference. I remember picking up a few of the techniques mentioned in the talk in TU Wien's practical software engineering courses; I've certainly done my share of cargo cult programming in that course ...

You should most definitely spend the hour on Kevlin Henney's talk; it's fun, informative, will make you laugh but it'll also encourage you to examine your coding practices.
