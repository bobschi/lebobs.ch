I have started working on a new design for the blog. I have made some very unlucky choices and stupid mistakes with the old one, and I'm trying to improve what's already here so I can look at it again. Here's a few of my grievances:

* I haven't planned for pictures in the old design
* I made a few stupid mark up choices
* Less colour!
* `strong`-tags break the vertical rhythm in the old design by increasing line height for some reason
* With the old design, displaying more than one paragraph of text on the front page looks butt ugly
* Actually, that ribbon is ugly as hell, it needs to go!
* Posts without teasers looked stupid
* Thanks to jekyll's, I needed to be careful about what characters I used in my teasers as well as do manual masking. That sucks!

And here's some of the ideas I'm toying around with:

* I don't to write teasers any more
* Increase my posting frequency by interlacing with shorter posts and links
* Think up categories and ways to mark them visually (especially focus on the difference between full post, short post and link)
* I need a working fall back font for the flourishing, ffs!
* I'm tying around with the idea of setting all headlines in lower case
* I want my posts on the index-page fully, without comments
* If you want to comment, you will be taken to the article few
* **Pictures**
* My branch layout for this blog's repository
* Is there a way I can maybe later migrate this to a python blog engine? Maybe something flask driven, on my own server?

When this post is published, the new design should be done. Hopefully. ;-)
