I have started working on a new design for the blog. I have made some very unlucky choices and stupid mistakes with the old one, and I'm trying to improve what's already here so I can look at it again. Here's a few of my grievances:

* I haven't planned for pictures in the old design
* I made a few stupid mark up choices
* I want my posts on the index-page fully, without comments
* If you want to comment, you will be taken to the article few
* Less colour!
* I'm tying around with the idea of setting all headlines in lower case
* I need a working fall back font for the flourishing, ffs!
* `strong`-tags break the vertical rhythm in the old design by increasing line height for some reason
