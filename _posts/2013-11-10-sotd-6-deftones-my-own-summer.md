For some reason I dug out the original Matrix soundtrack again. This is one of my favourite numbers off it. And it's perfect to have running in the background when playing a game of Starcraft II or three. Hm, I should really take the time and watch Matrix again.

The illustration was done by an awesome graphic artist from Berlin, [Felipe Tofani](https://www.facebook.com/felipetofani). You should keep an eye out for this man (I guess). His current works for the Month of Glitch are just fucking fantastic, by the way.
