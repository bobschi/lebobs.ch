Interesting read, and clever analysis.

Having no hardware buttons might be an appropriate model for iPads and iPhones, but it's annoying with my Kindle Paperwhite. I'd love to see his suggestions in a Kindle. I'm still spending a lot of time with my old Paperwhite, and I'm reading almost exclusively with it, and I won't upgrade it until it breaks. Unless, Amazon come out with a truly great offering that is close to what Craig mod suggests in his Medium piece.
