I'd like to start off this blog post with a lot of swear words, some of which you might have never heard. Others, that might make you blush. But I won't, I'm trying to be professional here, people.

## Some Definitions to Start Things Off ... Or Maybe Better Not.
I think that are many articles on Linux, so I am not going to write a detailed explanation of what Linux is and is not. If you don't know what [Unix][] or a [distribution][distro] is, if you have no clue about [FOSS[]] and [GNU][], please, consult [Wikipedia] before reading on, as I am not going to define or explain terms like these.
