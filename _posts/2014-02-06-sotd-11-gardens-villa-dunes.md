From the new album of Gardens & Villa. Some of the songs on it are so-so---Purple Mesas, anybody?---but songs like this or Domino make this album really shine. »Dunes« seems more melancholic than their first album »Gardens & Villa« but you still get that feeling of easyness and optimism that I loved about their first album. Where »Gardens & Villa« would be a good soundtrack for a roadtrip with a few of your friends, »Dunes« feels like it would be better suited for remeniscing about such things.
