Adam Ondra is doing a weekly Vlog of his preparations for the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo. This is going to be a staple of mine till it's time for the games, and I was excited to see the second installment. This week, he gives an overview of the combined format for sport climbing, and talks a little bit about planning his traning and trying to decide which discipline to focus on.

You can find the ["Road to Tokyo" playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcnvlELPEIA&list=PL4cmXgffCRMz9xMKxs0ftDJUH-n-WGTuy) on Adam's channel.

Bonus: If you're bored, go watch his "[Climbing the Americas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cmXgffCRMyT4iTKjaxnDERKMesPWWAI)" Vlog of his recent climbing trip to ... well, the Americas.
