title: My Goodreads Reading Challenge for 2019.
---

I have, so far, read 5 of 52 books for my current reading challenge. This means I'm a little bit behind the plan. But I'll rectify that over the next few weeks, and I expect to have time for a lot of reading in Italy. I usually read around 4--5 books when on holiday, and I'll be spending two weeks in Tuscany this April. The books I've read in 2019 are a mixed bunch; some of them could be considered part of the self-help category, some are Sci-Fi, and I'm currently reading fantasy. I've got a big stack of books I want to read about sex, relationships, and love, so this year's reading list is going to be a really mixed bunch indeed.

I started this year off with finishing the [Icerigger series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40661-icerigger) by Alan Dean Foster. It's pretty pulpy 1970s Sci-Fi, relaxing and uncomplicated to read. Exactly what I needed to relax in January this year. In parallel to that I read [Attached](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9547888-attached) and [Just Listen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6547576-just-listen), as I was struggling with a few things a bit. Relationships are hard. I've got way more books like that on my reading list.

To relax a bit, I started to reread Patrick Rothfuss' [The Kingkiller Chronicle](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45262-the-kingkiller-chronicle) Series, and I just finished reading the first book. It's a fun escape from the more serious parts of live.

Next up is [book 2 of The Kingkiller Chronicle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1215032.The_Wise_Man_s_Fear) as well as [The Bottoming Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433500.The_New_Bottoming_Book), [The New Topping Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503943.The_New_Topping_Book), [The 5 Love Languages](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23878688-the-5-love-languages), [Nonviolent Communication](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71730.Nonviolent_Communication), [Finish](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35397160-finish), [Slow Sex](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10054823-slow-sex) and [Storm Static Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28116379-storm-static-sleep), just to name a few.

Way too much to read, way too little time.
