I have started working on a new design for this blog. I've made some very unlucky choices and stupid mistakes with the old one, and I'm trying to improve what is already here so I can look at it again without going "oh my god, did I do that?". Here's a few of my grievances:

* didn't think about photos or pictures in general
* stupid mark up choices
* not too happy with the colour scheme
* `strong`-tags break the vertical rhythm in the old design
* displaying more than one paragraph of text on the front page looks butt ugly
* that ribbon is ugly as hell, it needs to go
* posts without teasers looked stupid
* lists are ugly
* headings are ugly

And here's some of the ideas I'm toying around with:

* don't want to write teasers any more
* increase posting frequency by interlacing with shorter posts and links
* think up categories and ways to mark them visually (especially focus on the difference between full post, short post and link)
* need a working fall back font for the flourishings
* all headlines in lower case, maybe?
* <del>want my posts on the index-page fully, without comments</del> done.
* if you want to comment, you will be taken to the article view
* pictures, photos, graphics, things to look at
* <del>my branch layout for this blog's repository.</del> done. the layout is as follows:
	* "default" branch for the status quo
	* "wip" and bookmarks for new blogposts
	* "design" for work on the design
* <del>Is there a way I can maybe later migrate this to a python blog engine? Maybe something flask driven, on my own server?</del> sticking with this, for the time being
* update to html5boilerplate 2.0

I want the following post types:

* text
* link
* photo
* video
* quote
* tweet

I want the following categories:

* meta
* personal
* computers
* hci
* design

While I am pretty sure about the post types---they are pretty standard ones---I am not too sure about the categories. They still don't feel right to me. And I need to find a way to get content online without the need to be at my workstation. Why can there be no comprise? A blog software or CMS that uses a DVCS and that I can edit via a web interface and in my favourite editor. Like github or bitbucket wikis allows me to. :(
