Times flies, as they say. I'm pretty busy at the moment. Part of that is my own fault, part of it is that I'm just trying to get a lot of stuff done, that I've been putting off for far too long.

I'm in Upper Austria right now, because there's a funeral to attend today. Then I'm going to stay either one or two more nights, to attend the Kultig talks and party tomorrow. I'm either going to leave on Friday, or on Saturday. And then, there's two full weeks ahead of me: I'm going to attend as many Vienna Open 2013 talks as I can, as well as a workshop and concert by Martin Kaltenbrunner. I'll try to blog about it. ;-)

Good hunting!
