Don't you hate it, too? You are happily typing/hacking/designing/... away and you just want to finish »that one last thing«TM. When you look back at the clock again, it's about 3:00 a.m. in the morning. Sure, you get stuff done. But on the other hand, you won't be up until midday. I hate being a night owl.
