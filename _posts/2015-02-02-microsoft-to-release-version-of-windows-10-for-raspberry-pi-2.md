Microsoft will release a version of Windows 10 that will run on Raspberry Pi 2. They will supposedly give it away as part of their Internet of Things Developer program. This sounds wickedly interesting, especially considering the following: With [Gadgeteer](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/gadgeteer/), Microsoft is really trying to position itself strongly in the Internet of Things area. Getting to work on software for hardware prototypes with high level tools like VS, .NET & C# sounds very much like fun.

It's kind of exciting to see such a behemoth as Microsoft do things again that, very confusingly, are kinda cool. I hope they get past the "kinda cool" and "they meant well" stage soon, though.
