teaser: I recently decided to not take the SIP1 a third time and instead focus my time and energy on finished my Bachelor's Degree in Health Informatics and acquire a Master of Media Informatics later on. A little bit on why I chose to quit and an ardent speech on the importance of saying <em>no</em>.

For all of you who don't yet know it: I decided to put my studies in Human Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna on ice for the time being. I've thought quite some time, since April, actually. I didn't really think about quitting, at least in the beginning, but I was trying to get an idea about how my life would be in the next five years, if I passed the SIP1 in June. How it would be, if I failed, and passed it in September. Or how if I couldn't pass it at all.
