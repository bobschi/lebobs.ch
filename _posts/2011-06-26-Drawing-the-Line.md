teaser: I recently decided to not take the SIP1 a third time and instead focus my time and energy on finishing my Bachelor's Degree in Health Informatics and acquire a Master in Informatics later on.

For all of you who don't yet know it: I decided to put my studies in Human Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna on ice for the time being. I've thought quite some time, since April, actually. I didn't really think about quitting, at least in the beginning, but I was trying to get an idea about how my life would be in the next five years if I passed the SIP1 in June. How it would be if I failed the nsext attempt but passed it in September. Or how it would play out if I couldn't pass it at all. Whatever outcome I could think of, the problem remained the same, and that simple discovery sealed the deal for me.

These are most likely the hardest words to say for me. I know that if I put my mind to something, and try hard enough, I can do it. If I tried to learn Russian, I'd most likely be able to at least master the basics, although I might never become a master. And I still think that I could be a good doctor.

But learning something requires time and space. Mastering something requires even more space and time plus focus and dedication. And you don't earn a medical degree and become a good doctor by just spending some time. You need to commit, to dedicate a lot of time and effort.

I knew that in the beginning, and I was ready to do this. But I was also not ready to let all the time and work I put into my Informatics Bachelor go to waste. And this is the first thing I couldn't really make work. It was just not good enough to only attend some classes in IT and spend the better part of my time on Medicine. I would have needed to spend almost all of my productive time on medicine, at least the last three to four months before the SIP1, and I just couldn't find the time.
