So, there's another Humble eBook Bundle on. You should get it. There are a few good reasons to immediately buy it, e.g. Wil Wheaton reading Cory Doctorow's »Homeland«, »Mogworld« by Ben »Yathzee« Croshaw or Wil Wheaton's »The Happiest Days of Our Lives«. It's just 15$ to unlock ALL TEH GOOD STUFFS including the audiobook. So gogogo, get it! :)

You should watch the trailer, by the way.
