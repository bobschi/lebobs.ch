Emancipator just released his latest album *Seven Seas* **today**! I'm currently on my first complete listen, so I'll be back later with some thoughts, but so far, I really like it. There's definitely some changes when comparing this to *Dusk to Dawn* or earlier albums, but it's still Emancipator without a doubt. Give it a listen!

I somehow completely missed [the announcement](http://www.emancipatormusic.com/announcing-seven-seas-album-tour) of the new album and a tour in July and the release of the video for [*Ocelot*](http://www.emancipatormusic.com/new-song-new-video-ocelot) in September. The new video is pretty awesome, by the way, and the track, *Ocelot*, reminds me a lot of stuff like *With Rainy Eyes*. The video is pretty nice as well, but I'm kind of a sucker for the low-poly models with low res tessellation models used throughout the video.
