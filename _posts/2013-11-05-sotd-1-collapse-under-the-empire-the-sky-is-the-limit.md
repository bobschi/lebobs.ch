I came upon this band while listening to the Gifts from Enola Rdio station. Really great post-rock from Hamburg, Germany. I've just finished listening through their last album, and so far I've been enjoying every minute of it. I'd love to see them play live. However, it appears that they don't do live shows ... well, their music is still the perfect soundtrack for a gloomy day like today.
